# Examples
This package contains examples on both using the library to read [from local files](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/RunRead.java) and [from URLs](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/RunReadFromURL.java), and to [write](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/RunWrite.java). All of the examples use the Team and Player classes as examples, as they should give a rough idea on using the library to save various types of things (strings, numbers, booleans and lists). Happy coding!
