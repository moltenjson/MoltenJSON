# SimpleJSON
SimpleJSON is a wide, feature-extensive JSON/[GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) library which aims on simplifying loads of JSON operations, which makes dealing with JSON a *piece of cake*.

# Features
* Extremely easy to use
* Well-documented code
* Easily read, write and handle JSON from any file or URL, using a basic reader, a basic configuration or a complex configuration.
* Different JSON utilities for simplifying building JSON.
* Clean, easy-to-read and heavily-documented code.
* Built and implemented to be thread-safe. This library supports running in multi-threaded environments.
* Outstanding performance and very fast.

# Using the library
Setting up the project to use SimpleJSON is explained in details in [this wiki page](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/wiki/Setting-up).

The library is configured to produce javadoc and sources JARs. This should allow you to browse JavaDocs from your project directly.

# Download
If your project does not use a build system like Maven or Gradle, then you should consider adding [JAR files](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/releases/) to your classpath instead.

# Examples & Wiki
Every entity and class in this library is explained in details in [SimpleJSON's wiki](https://github.com/ReflxctionDev/SimpleJSON/wiki). The wiki includes examples on the usage of each of them
